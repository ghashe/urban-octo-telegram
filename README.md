# Code Refactor Starter Code

##Project Title
Search Engine Optimization

##Description
It is one of the code refactor challenge assignments (HTML CSS and Git) designed to prepare us for a scenario that we’re likely to encounter as a web developer and to earn a certificate as full stack web developer from University of Minnesota Boot Camp by the year 2022

    I improved an existing site's HTML and CSS code to make it more accessible without changing what it does and hosting it on Github.
