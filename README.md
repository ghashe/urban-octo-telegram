## Description

The Horiseon Social Solution Services website code in this repository has been refactored <br/>
to make it more accessible for people with disabilities. The Horiseon website can now be <br/>
accessed by people with disabilities through assistive technologies such as video captions, <br/>
screen readers, and braille keyboards. Adding this feature to the website will ensure that <br/>
the website appears higher in search engine results, such as Google.<br/>
I improved functionality by modifying the codebase, which previously had some imperfections.<br/>
Previously, the navigation bar links did not work, but now they will take users to the right <br/>
place on the site. You can now see that semantic HTML elements are being used and are positioned <br/>
logically in the source code. The page has also been given a new title, which reads "Horiseon <br/>
Social Solution Services". This code is now more efficient, and the website will be more durable <br/>
for the long run.
